#  Deloitte Consulting – Forage Virtual Internship

##  Overview
This repository contains my completed work from the **Deloitte Technology Consulting Virtual Experience Program** offered by **Forage**.  
The program provided hands-on exposure to **real-world consulting projects**, emphasizing data analytics, visualization, and business insight generation through technology-driven solutions.

Through this virtual experience, I worked on data-focused challenges similar to what Deloitte’s consulting teams tackle — analyzing operational telemetry data and investigating gender pay equality using data analytics tools.

##  Task 1 – Daikibo Telemetry Data Analysis
**Objective:**  
Analyze machine telemetry data collected from Daikibo’s four factories (Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin, and Shenzhen) to determine:
1. Which factory had the highest machine downtime.  
2. Which device types were responsible for the most downtime.

**Tools Used:** Tableau, JSON  

** Key Work:**
- Created a calculated field (`Unhealthy`) representing 10 minutes of downtime per unhealthy log.  
- Designed interactive dashboards showing downtime per factory and per device type.  
- Enabled dashboard filtering to dynamically analyze factory-level breakdowns.

**Findings:**  
- Factory with the highest downtime: **Daikibo Seiko (Osaka, Japan)**  
- Machines causing most downtime: **LaserCutter** and **LaserWelder**

##  Task 2 – Gender Pay Equality Analysis
**Objective:**  
Classify employee pay equality scores across job roles and factories to detect pay disparities.

**Tools Used:** Excel, Conditional Logic (IF, AND, OR)

**Key Work:**
- Added a new column `Equality Class` to categorize scores as **Fair**, **Unfair**, or **Highly Discriminative**.  
- Automated classification using logical conditions for accurate categorization.

**Findings:**  
- Provided insight into pay fairness and potential discrimination patterns.  
- Supported data-driven recommendations for improving equality.
